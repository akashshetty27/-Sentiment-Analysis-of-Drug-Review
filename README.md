# -Sentiment-Analysis-of-Drug-Review
In this project we consider the retrospective drug utilization review which refers to drug therapy review after patients have got the medication. The retrospective drug utilization review is a typical process wherein we categorize the review made by the patient based on NLP algorithms. The reviews are categorized into positive, negative and neutral words based on Countvectorizer and TF-IDFVectorizer. Later on, we went with 2 classes namely Positive and Negative with classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes Classifier, Bagging and Boosting models were applied. Random Forest with GridSearchCV was found to be the most effective algorithm with an F1 score of 77%.
